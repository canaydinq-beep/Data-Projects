## 🏗️ How It Was Built (Step-by-Step)

This project isn't just a static report; it's a dynamic tool built on a robust data architecture. Here is the process behind the scenes:

### 1️⃣ The Data Foundation
The analysis is powered by a comprehensive dataset containing over **32,000 real-world job postings**. As seen below, the raw data includes critical dimensions such as *Job Location, Schedule Type, Posted Date, and Salary Estimates*.

*A glimpse of the organized dataset serving as the backend.*

### 2️⃣ Advanced Logic & Formulas
To make the dashboard interactive **without using VBA**, I utilized complex array formulas and conditional logic. The metrics (e.g., Median Salary) calculate dynamically based on the user's selection in the slicers.
